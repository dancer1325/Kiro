Agent hooks are powerful automation tools that streamline your development workflow by automatically executing predefined agent actions when specific events occur in your IDE. With hooks, you eliminate the need to manually request routine tasks and ensure consistency across your codebase.
What are agent hooks?
Agent hooks are automated triggers that execute predefined agent actions when specific events occur in your IDE. Rather than manually asking for routine tasks to be performed, hooks set up automated responses to events such as:
Saving files
Creating new files
Deleting files
Agent hooks transform your development workflow through intelligent automation. By setting up hooks for common tasks, you can:
Maintain consistent code quality
Prevent security vulnerabilities
Reduce manual overhead
Standardize team processes
Create faster development cycles
Whether you're working on a small project or managing a large codebase, agent hooks help ensure that routine tasks are handled automatically and consistently, allowing you to focus on building great software.
How agent hooks work
The agent hook system follows a simple three-step process:
Event Detection: The system monitors for specific events in your IDE
Prompt Execution: When an event occurs, a predefined prompt is sent to the agent
Automated Action: The agent processes the prompt and performs the requested actions
This automation flow eliminates repetitive tasks and ensures consistency across your codebase.
Setting up agent hooks
Creating and managing hooks is straightforward:
Using the explorer view
Navigate to the Agent Hooks section in the Kiro panel
Click the + button to create a new hook

You can also use the Command Palette to navigate to the Hook UI:
Open the command palette with Cmd + Shift + P (Mac) or Ctrl + Shift + P (Windows/Linux)
Type Kiro: Open Kiro Hook UI
Follow the on-screen instructions to create your hook
