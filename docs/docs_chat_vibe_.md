What is a Vibe session?
Vibe sessions are interactive Q&A-focused sessions in Kiro that are designed for quick questions, explanations, and building projects through a more conversational approach.
How to access
You can switch between Vibe sessions and Spec sessions using the session picker when you launch a new session. This allows you to choose the interaction style that best suits your current task.

When to Vibe
Interactive Q&A Format: Vibe sessions are optimized for back-and-forth conversations about code, allowing you to ask questions and get immediate responses.
Quick Assistance: They're ideal for getting quick answers to coding questions, explanations of code behavior, or understanding concepts without going through a formal specification process.
Contextual Understanding: Like other Kiro sessions, Vibe sessions leverage context providers to understand your codebase, but with a focus on explanation rather than extensive code generation.
Flexible Approach: Vibe sessions offer a more fluid, less structured approach compared to Spec sessions, making them suitable for exploratory coding and learning.
What is a Spec session?
A Spec session guides you through a structured approach to complex development tasks in Kiro that formalizes the software development process. It transforms high-level ideas into detailed implementation plans with systematic execution and clear tracking.
How to access
You can switch between Spec sessions and Vibe sessions using the session picker when you launch a new session. For complex development tasks, Spec sessions provide the structure needed to ensure thorough implementation.

When to Spec
Complex Development Tasks: Use Spec sessions for building complex features, entire applications, or significant refactoring that requires careful planning and execution.
Structured Approach: When you need a methodical, step-by-step approach to development with clear documentation of requirements and implementation details.
Team Collaboration: For projects where multiple team members need to understand the implementation plan and track progress against specifications.
Documentation Needs: When you want to generate detailed documentation alongside your code implementation for future reference or knowledge sharing.
