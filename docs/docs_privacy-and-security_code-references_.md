Kiro learns, in part, from open-source projects. Sometimes, a suggestion it's giving you may be similar to publicly available code. Code references include information about the source Kiro used to generate a recommendation.
This section describes how you can view, edit, and configure code references.
Code reference log
With the code reference log, you can view references to code recommendations that are similar to publicly available code. You can also update and edit code recommendations suggested by Kiro.
Turn code references off and on
To turn off code references, go to Settings and then Code References.
Opt out of code with references as an enteprise administrator
Kiro enterprise administrators can opt out of getting code suggestions with references for all users. Kiro enterprise users don't have control over this setting; it's controlled by the administrator and can't be overridden.
Administrators can opt out of code references in the Kiro console. For more information, see Kiro enterprise settings.Page updated: November 18, 2025Data protectionCompliance validation
