Change Kiro subscription plans
Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
Switch to the Kiro console. If you don't see it, you might be in the wrong AWS Region.
In the Users & Groups page, choose the Users or Groups tab.
Choose the user or group whose subscriptions you want to upgrade or downgrade.
Choose Change plan then choose the new plan. Select Continue to finish.
If it is a higher tier plan, changes will happen immediately. If it is a lower tier plan, changes happen at the beginning of the following month.
InfoTo learn about what's offered at each subscription tier, see Enterprise billing.
Unsubscribe Kiro users
Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
Switch to the Kiro console. If you don't see it, you might be in the wrong AWS Region.
In the Users & Groups page, choose the Users or Groups tab.
Choose the user or group whose subscriptions you want to cancel.
Choose Deactivate plan. Review the contents of the Unsubscribee dialog box then choose Unsubscribe.
InfoAfter unsubscribing users, their subscriptions are marked as Canceled. They will have until the end of the month to use credits from the current plan. Starting the following month, they can no longer access paid Kiro features.
Enable overages for Kiro users
You might want to enable overages to give users the ability to continue working when they exceed their plan limits. Enabling overages has the following advantages:
Uninterrupted productivity â When a user exceeds their plan's quota, they can continue working without disruption. The productivity benefits of continued access might outweigh the additional costs.
Better usage pattern insights â Users get more accurate data about their actual usage, which helps in right-sizing future subscription needs.
By default, overages are disabled. Once enabled, overages become available to all users and groups in the profile. To enable overages:
Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
Switch to the Kiro console. If you don't see it, you might be in the wrong AWS Region.
Choose Settings.
Find the Kiro settings section.
Turn on Overages.
InfoSetting custom caps for overages is not yet supported (coming soon).
Subscription statuses
You can view the status of your users' subscriptions on the Subscriptions page of the Kiro console. The statuses on the User tab are:
Active â The user is subscribed to Kiro. You will be charged for active user subscriptions in the group.
Canceled â The user subscription was canceled by an administrator. Unsubscribed users in the group can no longer access paid Kiro features. For more information, see Unsubscribe Kiro users.
Pending â The user is subscribed but has not activated their subscription. You are not being charged for this subscription and there will be no data under Last active column.
InfoThere are no statuses on the Groups tab since subscriptions are assigned to users, not groups.Page updated: November 16, 2025Subscribe your teamSupported regions
