The /knowledge command provides persistent knowledge base functionality for Kiro CLI, allowing you to store, search, and manage contextual information that persists across chat sessions.
Getting started
Enable knowledge feature
Knowledge management is experimental and must be enabled before use:
bashkiro-cli settings chat.enableKnowledge true
Basic usage
Once enabled, use /knowledge commands within your chat session:
bash/knowledge add --name myproject --path /path/to/project
/knowledge show
Commands
/knowledge show
Display all entries in your knowledge base with detailed information including creation dates, item counts, and persistence status. Also shows any active background indexing operations with progress and ETA.
This unified command provides a complete view of both your stored knowledge and ongoing operations.
bash/knowledge show
/knowledge add
Add files or directories to your knowledge base. The system recursively indexes all supported files in directories.
Syntax:
bash/knowledge add --name <name> --path <path> [--include pattern] [--exclude pattern] [--index-type Fast|Best]
Required Parameters:
--name or -n: Descriptive name for the knowledge entry
--path or -p: Path to file or directory to index
Examples:
bash/knowledge add --name "project-docs" --path /path/to/documentation
/knowledge add -n "config-files" -p /path/to/config.json
/knowledge add --name "fast-search" --path /path/to/logs --index-type Fast
/knowledge add -n "semantic-search" -p /path/to/docs --index-type Best
Index types
Choose the indexing approach that best fits your needs:
Fast (Lexical - bm25)
Advantages:
â
Lightning-fast indexing - processes files quickly
â
Instant search - keyword-based with immediate results
â
Low resource usage - minimal CPU and memory
â
Perfect for logs, configs, and large codebases
Disadvantages:
â Less intelligent - requires exact keyword matches
Best (Semantic - all-minilm-l6-v2)
Advantages:
â
Intelligent search - understands context and meaning
â
Natural language queries - search with full sentences
â
Finds related concepts - even without exact keywords
â
Perfect for documentation and research
Disadvantages:
â Slower indexing - requires AI model processing
â Higher resource usage - more CPU and memory intensive

Default behavior
If you don't specify --index-type, the system uses your configured default:
bash# Set your preferred default
kiro-cli settings knowledge.indexType Fast   # or Best
# This will use your default setting
/knowledge add "my-project" /path/to/project
Pattern filtering
Control which files are indexed using include and exclude patterns:
bash/knowledge add "rust-code" /path/to/project --include "*.rs" --exclude "target/**"
/knowledge add "docs" /path/to/project --include "**/*.md" --include "**/*.txt" --exclude "node_modules/**"
Pattern Examples:
*.rs - All Rust files recursively (equivalent to **/*.rs)
**/*.py - All Python files recursively
target/** - Everything in target directory
node_modules/** - Everything in node_modules
Default Pattern Behavior:
When you don't specify patterns, the system uses configured defaults:
bashkiro-cli settings knowledge.defaultIncludePatterns '["**/*.rs", "**/*.py"]'
kiro-cli settings knowledge.defaultExcludePatterns '["target/**", "__pycache__/**"]'
# Uses default patterns
/knowledge add "my-project" /path/to/project
# Overrides defaults
/knowledge add "docs-only" /path/to/project --include "**/*.md"
Supported file types
Text files: .txt, .log, .rtf, .tex, .rst
Markdown: .md, .markdown, .mdx
JSON: .json (treated as text for searchability)
Configuration: .ini, .conf, .cfg, .properties, .env
Data files: .csv, .tsv
Web formats: .svg (text-based)
Code files: .rs, .py, .js, .jsx, .ts, .tsx, .java, .c, .cpp, .h, .hpp, .go, .rb, .php, .swift, .kt, .kts, .cs, .sh, .bash, .zsh, .html, .htm, .xml, .css, .scss, .sass, .less, .sql, .yaml, .yml, .toml
Special files: Dockerfile, Makefile, LICENSE, CHANGELOG, README (files without extensions)
Note: Unsupported files are indexed without text content extraction.
/knowledge remove
Remove entries from your knowledge base by name, path, or context ID.
bash/knowledge remove "project-docs"  # Remove by name
/knowledge remove /path/to/old/project  # Remove by path
/knowledge update
Update an existing knowledge base entry with new content. Original include/exclude patterns are preserved.
bash/knowledge update /path/to/updated/project
/knowledge clear
Remove all entries from your knowledge base. Requires confirmation and cannot be undone.
bash/knowledge clear
You'll be prompted:
â ï¸ This will remove ALL knowledge base entries. Are you sure? (y/N):
/knowledge cancel
Cancel background operations. Cancel specific operation by ID or all operations.
bash/knowledge cancel abc12345  # Cancel specific operation
/knowledge cancel all       # Cancel all operations
Configuration
Configure knowledge base behavior:
bash# Maximum files per knowledge base
kiro-cli settings knowledge.maxFiles 10000
# Text chunk size for processing
kiro-cli settings knowledge.chunkSize 1024
# Overlap between chunks
kiro-cli settings knowledge.chunkOverlap 256
# Default index type
kiro-cli settings knowledge.indexType Fast
# Default include patterns
kiro-cli settings knowledge.defaultIncludePatterns '["**/*.rs", "**/*.md"]'
# Default exclude patterns
kiro-cli settings knowledge.defaultExcludePatterns '["target/**", "node_modules/**"]'
Agent-specific knowledge bases
Isolated knowledge storage
Each agent maintains its own isolated knowledge base, ensuring knowledge contexts are scoped to the specific agent you're working with. This provides better organization and prevents knowledge conflicts.
Folder structure
Knowledge bases are stored in:
~/.kiro/knowledge_bases/
âââ kiro_cli_default/          # Default agent
â   âââ contexts.json
â   âââ context-id-1/
â   â   âââ data.json
â   â   âââ bm25_data.json
â   âââ context-id-2/
â       âââ data.json
âââ my-custom-agent_<code>/    # Custom agent
â   âââ contexts.json
â   âââ context-id-3/
â       âââ data.json
âââ another-agent_<code>/      # Another agent
âââ contexts.json
âââ context-id-4/
âââ data.json
How agent isolation works
Automatic Scoping: /knowledge commands operate on current agent's knowledge base
No Cross-Agent Access: Agent A cannot access Agent B's knowledge
Independent Configuration: Each agent has different settings and contexts
Migration Support: Legacy knowledge bases migrate to default agent
Agent switching
When you switch agents, knowledge commands automatically work with that agent's knowledge base:
bash# Working with default agent
/knowledge add /path/to/docs
# Switch to custom agent
kiro chat --agent my-custom-agent
# Creates separate knowledge base for my-custom-agent
/knowledge add /path/to/agent/docs
# Switch back to default
kiro chat
# Only sees original docs, not agent-specific docs
/knowledge show
How it works
Indexing process
Pattern Filtering: Files filtered by include/exclude patterns
File Discovery: Recursive scan for supported file types
Content Extraction: Text extracted from each file
Chunking: Large files split into searchable chunks
Background Processing: Asynchronous indexing
Semantic Embedding: Content processed for semantic search
Search capabilities
Knowledge bases use semantic search:
Natural language queries
Results ranked by relevance, not just keywords
Related concepts found even without exact word matches
Persistence
Contexts survive across chat sessions and CLI restarts
Persistence determined automatically by usage patterns
Include/exclude patterns stored and reused during updates
Best practices
Organizing your knowledge base
Use descriptive names: "api-documentation" not "docs"
Group related files in directories before adding
Use include/exclude patterns to focus on relevant files
Regularly review and update outdated contexts
Effective searching
Use natural language: "how to handle authentication errors using the knowledge tool"
Be specific: "database connection configuration"
Try different phrasings if initial searches don't work
Prompt Kiro to use the tool: "find database connection configuration using your knowledge bases"
Managing large projects
Add project directories rather than individual files
Use patterns to avoid build artifacts: --exclude "target/**" --exclude "node_modules/**"
Use /knowledge show to monitor indexing progress
Consider breaking large projects into logical sub-directories
Pattern filtering best practices
Be specific: Use precise patterns to avoid over-inclusion
Exclude build artifacts: Always exclude target/**, node_modules/**, .git/**
Include relevant extensions: Focus on file types you need
Test patterns: Verify patterns match expected files before large operations
Limitations
File type support
Binary files ignored during indexing
Very large files may be chunked, potentially splitting related content
Some specialized formats may not extract content optimally
Performance considerations
Large directories may take significant time to index
Background operations limited by concurrent processing
Search performance varies by knowledge base size
Pattern filtering improves performance for large directories
Storage and persistence
No explicit storage size limits, but practical limits apply
No automatic cleanup of old or unused contexts
Clear operations are irreversible with no backup
Troubleshooting
Files not being indexed
Check patterns: Ensure include patterns match your files
Verify exclude patterns: Make sure they're not filtering desired files
Check file types: Ensure files have supported extensions
Monitor progress: Use /knowledge show to check indexing status
Verify paths: Ensure paths exist and are accessible
Check for errors: Look for error messages in CLI output
Search not finding expected results
Wait for indexing: Use /knowledge show to ensure completion
Try different queries: Use various phrasings and keywords
Verify content: Confirm content was added with /knowledge show
Check file types: Unsupported types won't have searchable content
Performance issues
Check operations: Use /knowledge show for progress
Cancel if needed: Use /knowledge cancel for problematic operations
Add smaller chunks: Consider subdirectories instead of entire projects
Use better patterns: Exclude unnecessary files
Adjust settings: Lower maxFiles or chunkSize for better performance
Pattern issues
Test patterns: Start simple, then add complexity
Check syntax: Ensure glob patterns use correct syntax (** for recursive)
Verify paths: Make sure patterns match actual file paths
Use absolute patterns: Consider full paths for precision
