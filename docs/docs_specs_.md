What are specs?
Specs or specifications are structured artifacts that formalize the development process for complex features in your application. They provide a systematic approach to transform high-level ideas into detailed implementation plans with clear tracking and accountability.
With Kiro's specs, you can:
Break down requirements into user stories with acceptance criteria
Build design docs with sequence diagrams and architecture plans
Track implementation progress across discrete tasks
Collaborate effectively between product and engineering teams
