We may use certain content from Kiro Free Tier and Kiro individual subscribers for service improvement. For more information on service improvement and how to opt out, see Service improvement.
Kiro is an AWS application that works as a standalone agentic IDE without needing to set up an AWS account. You can download and use Kiro immediately without any external account setup - it handles AI interactions and code assistance directly through the application itself. Whether you're developing with other AWS services or not, you can leverage Kiro's full capabilities to enhance your development workflow.
