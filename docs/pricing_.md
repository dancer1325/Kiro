New users can start with the perpetual Kiro Free tier, which includes 50 credits. You can upgrade to paid tiers ranging from Pro ($20/month), Pro+ ($40/month), to Power ($200/month) for increased capacity. Paid tiers include flexible overages available at $0.04 per additional credit. Kiro prices shown do not include applicable taxes or duties (such as VAT or sales tax) unless explicitly noted. Note that if you have a Japanese billing address, Japanese Consumption Tax will apply to your Kiro usage. The amount of tax collected depends on many factors, including, but not limited to, your Tax Registration Number (âTRNâ or Tax ID), and billing address.
What models does Kiro use under the hood?What models does Kiro use under the hood?By default, your prompts are processed by Auto an agent that uses a mix of different frontier models such as Sonnet 4 combined with specialized models that are experts in specific tasks, intent detection, caching, and other techniques to give you a better balance of quality, latency, and costs. You can also choose to have your prompts processed exclusively by Sonnet 4.

What is a credit?What is a credit?A credit is a unit of work in response to user prompts. Simple prompts can consume less than 1 credit. More complex prompts, such as executing a spec task, typically cost more than 1 credit. Additionally, different models consume credits at different rates, with a prompt executed via Sonnet 4 costing more credits than executing it with Auto. For example, a given task that consumes X credits to execute in Auto, will cost you 1.3X credits to execute via Sonnet 4. Credits are metered to the second decimal point, so the least number of credits a task can consume is 0.01 credits.
What can I use credits for?What can I use credits for?Any prompt you ask Kiro to execute, whether in vibe mode or spec mode, as well as spec refinement, task execution, and agent hook execution, will consume credits.
How can I track my credit usage?How can I track my credit usage?You can see the monthly credit limits for your plan, the number of credits used, and credits remaining in your subscription dashboard accessible in the Kiro IDE. Credit usage is updated at least every 5 minutes.
Can I pay for additional credits?Can I pay for additional credits?Yes, on paid plans, you can enable overage to continue using Kiro past your monthly limits. Additional credits are $0.04 each, billed at month-end based on actual over-cap usage. For example, if you're on the Pro tier and use 1,100 credits (100 over your limit), you'll be charged an additional $4 on your next bill. Overage is disabled by default and must be enabled in Settings before it applies. Once you turn overages on, and for as long as you remain on a paid plan, overages stay on. Once you downgrade to the Kiro Free tier, overages will be disabled, and you need to turn them back on when you are back on a paid plan.
Can I share my Kiro subscription with my team?Can I share my Kiro subscription with my team?No, subscriptions and usage limits are calculated per individual user. For team usage, each developer needs their own subscription. Team billing and management features are coming soon.
What happens if I don't use all my monthly credits?What happens if I don't use all my monthly credits?Usage limits reset at the start of each billing month. Unused credits do not roll over to the next month.
