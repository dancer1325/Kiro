# Enabling overages - IDE - Docs - Kiro

Source: https://kiro.dev/docs/billing/overages/

---

If you subscribed to the Pro, Pro+, or Power tier, you might consider enabling overages. Overages are additional fees that AWS charges when you exceed the predetermined credit limits or allowances specified in your plan.
Overages are disabled by default.
InfoYou can't incur overages at the Kiro Free tier. When you hit a credit limit, you must wait until the next month for your quotas to reset.
Why allow overages?
Allowing overages rather than disabling them completely has the following advantages:
Uninterrupted productivity â When you exceed your plan's quota, you can continue working without disruption. The productivity benefits of continued access might outweigh the additional costs.
Better credit pattern insights â You get more accurate data about your actual usage, which helps in right-sizing future subscription needs.
