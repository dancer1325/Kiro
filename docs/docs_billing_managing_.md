Troubleshooting payment issues
When a payment fails, you'll receive an email notification, your subscription status will change to "past due", and you will lose access to paid features. Our system automatically retries failed payments over several days. Once payment succeeds, paid plan access will immediately be restored and you'll receive a confirmation. You can also reactivate your subscription by updating your payment method and paying any outstanding balance.
If you're experiencing payment issues:
Check that your card hasn't expired and has sufficient funds
Update payment information if needed
Contact your bank to check if they blocked the charge
