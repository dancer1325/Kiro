Back to all postsAugust 15, 2025Kiro pricing plans are now liveByNINima KavianiProductDADavid CooperProductRead our latest blog post on billing and pricing.Over the past few weeks, we have shared several important Kiro pricing updates. We made these updates to our pricing model in response to your feedback. Many in our community have asked for a way to use Kiro above and beyond the daily preview limits, while others have been eager to get off the waitlist and try Kiro for themselves. Weâre making pricing plans available today, which means we can accelerate onboarding of all Kiro enthusiasts already on our waitlist, and give existing users more control over their Kiro usage.What this means for youAs of today, users logging in with Google, GitHub, or an AWS Builder ID account without a Q Developer subscription have been transitioned to our new pricing model. Those accounts are now on the Free tier, which includes 50 Vibe requests per month and 0 Spec requests.We're also introducing a welcome bonus of 100 Spec requests and 100 Vibe requests for all users. This bonus is available within the first 14 days of usage on the new pricing plans, and starts counting from your first request, regardless of which tier you're on. This gives you time to experience Kiro's full capabilities and figure out your usage needs.When you're ready to upgrade, you have three paid options:Loading image...Monitoring your usageYou can monitor month-to-date usage against plan limits for both Vibe and Spec requests, track overage charges if enabled, and manage your subscription plan.
